# Matlab_OOP_Analysis
This is an OOD framework in Matlab, designed for development of CAE applications. The framework supports all the computational methods that can yield a numerical model as a mix of bilinear and linear forms, e.g. FEM, BEM, IGA, etc. This framework is designed to function with the OOCAGD framework.
